# ZapTranslation
This library is used to translate some of the Zap tools to other languages 
than English. Because many of the wordings belong to more than one tool
this is an own library.

## Creating
If you want to add a new language for tools, copy the String.resx file, 
change the name of the file to String.<Your language abrivation>.resx
and change the Value side for all entries in the file.
